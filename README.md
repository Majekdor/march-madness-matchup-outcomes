# march-madness-matchup-outcomes

This program takes any number of game match-ups and tells you all possible outcomes of those match-ups.

The use case that inspired this program was a friend wanting a perfect bracket through the first day of March Madness. He used this to make 32 brackets based on all possible outcomes of 5 different games. 
> He thought there were only 5 games where it could go either way... he was wrong.
